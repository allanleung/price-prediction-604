# Price Prediction of Vancouver Housing using ML

This was a project I was assigned to work on. The .csv file is private but the model and juypternotebook is here.

The general approach to this huge dataset was as follows. 

* Clean rows and columns and knock out easy low hanging fruits
* Data preprocessing 
* Handling Null Values
* Standardization
* Handling Categorical Variables
* One-Hot Encoding
* Multicollinearity

After the it's a lot of trial and erorr to see what model works and getting a good score. The results is in the notebook.
